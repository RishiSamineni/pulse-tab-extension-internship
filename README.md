# pulsetab-browser-extension-internship (Repository for Learning Process)

Welcome to the **pulsetab-extension-internship** repository! This project is part of my internship journey, focused on developing a browser extension. It serves as a dedicated space for learning and experimenting with frond-end technologies like Angular, Bootstrap etc. that will be integral to the main project.

## üß† Learning Objectives

### Front End Technologies / TechStack

* **HTML, CSS/SCSS**
* **Bootstrap framework**
* **Angular**
* **Typescript**
* **Firebase SDK** (for frontend integration)

### Important Aspects:

* **Project setup and structure:** Use Angular CLI to create a new project, and organize the file structure for maintainability.
* **Component design and implementation:** Break down the application into reusable components, each with its own template, style, and logic.
* **Data binding:** Utilize Angular's data binding to connect the UI with the application data.
* **Routing:** Configure routes to enable navigation between different parts of the application.
* **State management:** Consider using a state management library like NgRx for complex applications.
* **Bootstrap integration:** Utilize Bootstrap's CSS framework and components for styling and layout.
* **Responsive design:** Ensure the application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## üìå Notes

* This is **not a production-level project**. It's a **learning and prototyping** space where I‚Äôm actively experimenting with tools and best practices.
* Expect frequent updates and changes as I continue to learn and iterate.

## üìçStep-by-Step Process

* **Set Up Angular Workspace & Codebase Structure**
* **Design and Implement Core Components**
* **Integrate State Management (NgRx or Signals)**
* **Develop the Browser Extension UI**
* **Connect with Backend APIs and Authentication**
