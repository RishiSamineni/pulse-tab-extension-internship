# pulsetab-extension-internship

Welcome to the **pulsetab-extension-internship** repository! This project is part of my internship journey, focused on developing a browser extension. It serves as a dedicated space for learning and experimenting with backend technologies that will be integral to the main project.

## üöÄ Purpose

This repository is my **personal learning ground** for exploring and integrating Firebase technologies needed for the development of a fully functional browser extension.

## üß† Learning Scope

Technologies & Services I'm exploring:

* ** HTML, CSS/SCSS
* ** Bootstrap framework
* ** Angular
* ** Typescript

Focus areas:

* **Project setup and structure:** Use Angular CLI to create a new project, and organize the file structure for maintainability.
* **Component design and implementation:** Break down the application into reusable components, each with its own template, style, and logic.
* **Data binding:** Utilize Angular's data binding to connect the UI with the application data.
* **Routing:** Configure routes to enable navigation between different parts of the application.
* **State management:** Consider using a state management library like NgRx for complex applications.
* **Bootstrap integration:** Utilize Bootstrap's CSS framework and components for styling and layout.
* **Responsive design:** Ensure the application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## üìå Notes

* This is **not a production-level project**. It's a **learning and prototyping** space where I‚Äôm actively experimenting with tools and best practices.
* Expect frequent updates and changes as I continue to learn and iterate.

## üìç Steps

* ** Set Up Angular Workspace & Codebase Structure
* ** Design and Implement Core Components
* ** Integrate State Management (NgRx or Signals)
* ** Develop the Browser Extension UI
* ** Connect with Backend APIs and Authentication
